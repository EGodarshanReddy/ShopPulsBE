// DEPRECATED: Neon/Drizzle-based database initialization.
// This project has been migrated to use Supabase for storage. The original
// `server/db.ts` file has been kept as a placeholder to avoid accidental
// deletes; do not use this file — import `storage` from `./storage` instead.

// If you want to remove this file entirely, ensure no modules import it
// and then delete it.
